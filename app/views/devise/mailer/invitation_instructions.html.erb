<p>Hello <%= @resource.email %>,</p>

<p>We’re excited to offer you a special preview of <a href='http://beta.popuparchive.org'> beta.popuparchive.org</a>!</p> 

<p>What does it mean to beta test? To begin, we’ll let you loose in the archive. You can add audio publicly or privately and view <b>automatically generated transcripts and keywords</b>. You can also <b>search your own sounds</b> or a range of collections from producers, stations, and archives.</p>

<p>As for you? Have fun, ask questions, complain, be honest. We’ll follow up with a short survey — and we’re releasing new features all the time. <b>Your input is crucial</b> in order for Pop Up Archive to reach its full potential, so don’t hold back!</p>
	 
<p>We really want to know what you like, what you don’t like, what goes wrong or is unclear, and what features you’d like to see in the future or just aren't useful for you.</p>

<p>Ready to unlock the archive? <b><%= link_to 'Accept invitation', accept_invitation_url(@resource, :invitation_token => @resource.invitation_token) %></b></p>

<p>We're glad to have you! There will always be a free version of Pop Up Archive — with your help, we're building an amazing collection of sound from around the world.</p>
